- `about.html` â€” About & values  
- `projects.html` â€” Current projects & descriptions

## Notes & tips
- Replace placeholder links & images in `shop.html` and `projects.html` with real content.
- If you host on GitHub Pages, ensure the files are in the root (or update paths).
- To add images, create an `assets/` directory and reference them (e.g. `assets/my-sticker.jpg`).
- If you'd like a working purchase flow, I can wire Stripe / Gumroad / Ko-fi links next.
